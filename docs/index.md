# Tasks Map

**Tasks Map** is an Obsidian plugin that visualizes your tasks as an interactive graph. It supports both **inline checkbox tasks** (`- [ ] task text`) through Obsidian's native metadata index and **file-based tasks** (NoteTask) where an entire note becomes a task through frontmatter metadata. Each task is represented as a node, with edges showing relationships.

!!! note
    Tasks Map is currently pre-v1.0. Interfaces such as the embed format, filter field names, and settings may change between releases before v1.0 is reached.

## Features

- **Graph Visualization:** See all your tasks as draggable nodes in a React Flow graph.
- **Dual Task Sources:** Supports natively indexed inline `- [ ]` checkbox tasks and file-based NoteTask notes — any note with `tags: [task]` in its frontmatter becomes a task node.
- **Custom Nodes:** Each node displays task summary, tags, priority emoji, and completion status (color-coded).
- **Task Relationships:** Edges are created based on special emoji/link syntax (🆔 for outgoing, ⛔ for incoming, with hashes) for inline tasks, or `blockedBy` / `dependsOn` frontmatter fields for NoteTask notes.
- **Edge Management:** Select and delete edges (removes the hash from both tasks/files).
- **Tag Filtering:** Filter visible tasks by tag using a multi-select dropdown overlay.
- **Quick Navigation:** Open the linked file for any task directly from the node.
- **Task Completion:** Mark tasks as completed/incomplete directly from the graph.
- **UI Overlays:** Modern overlays for tag filtering and reloading tasks.
- **Priority & Emoji Support:** Priority emoji (🔺, ⏫, 🔼, 🔽, ⏬) and robust emoji rendering.
- **Automatic Layout:** Uses dagre for clean, readable graph layouts.
- **Internationalization:** Support for multiple languages (English, Dutch, Simplified Chinese) with easy language switching in settings.
