# Usage

## Opening the View

Open the Tasks Map view in one of two ways:

- Click the **map** icon in the left ribbon.
- Open the command palette (`Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`) and run **Tasks Map: Open map view**.

The view opens in the main editor area and displays all tasks from your vault as an interactive graph.

## The Graph Canvas

Each task is represented as a node. Edges between nodes indicate task dependencies.

- **Drag nodes** to rearrange them on the canvas.
- **Pan** by clicking and dragging the canvas background.
- **Zoom** with the scroll wheel or trackpad pinch.
- **Select a node** by clicking it.
- **Preview a task's source note** by holding `Ctrl` on Windows/Linux or
  `Cmd` on macOS while hovering over a non-interactive area of its card.

Hover previews use Obsidian's Page Preview core plugin. The modifier requirement
can be changed for Tasks Map in Page Preview's settings. If the Hover Editor
community plugin is installed, the same popover can also edit the source note.

## Task Node Actions

Each task node has several controls in its header:

| Control                     | Action                                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Status toggle (circle icon) | Toggle the task's completion status       |
| Star button                 | Mark or unmark the task as starred        |
| Link button                 | Open the task's source file in the editor |
| Menu button (⋮)             | Open the task context menu                |

### Task Context Menu

Click the **⋮** button on a node to open the context menu:

| Action      | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create task | Open the Tasks plugin modal to create a new child task (requires the [Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin) |
| Edit task   | Open the Tasks plugin modal to edit the task in place (requires the Tasks plugin)                                                            |
| Delete task | Remove the task from the vault                                                                                                               |

### Tags on Nodes

When **Show task tags** is enabled in settings, each node displays its tags. You can:

- **Remove a tag** by clicking the × on a tag chip.
- **Add a tag** by clicking the **+ Add tag** button and typing a tag name.

## Edge Actions

Click an edge to select it. Press `Backspace` or `Delete` to remove the selected edge. Deleting an edge removes the corresponding dependency reference from both tasks in the vault.

## The Filter Panel

The filter panel sits on the right side of the canvas. Click the **chevron** button (‹) to minimize it; click again to expand it.

### Search

Type in the search bar to find tasks by summary, ID, or tag. As you type, a suggestion list appears with up to eight matching tasks.

**Keyboard shortcuts in the search bar:**

| Key       | Action                                                                |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `↓` / `↑` | Navigate suggestions                                                  |
| `Enter`   | Confirm selection or submit the current query                         |
| `Escape`  | Dismiss suggestions (or clear the search if no suggestions are shown) |

Click the **×** button to clear the current search.

When a search returns results, two checkboxes appear below the result count:

| Checkbox          | Description                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Show dependencies | Also show tasks that the matched tasks depend on (upstream)   |
| Show dependents   | Also show tasks that depend on the matched tasks (downstream) |

Both checkboxes can be active at the same time.

### Filters

| Filter             | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Status             | Multi-select dropdown — show only tasks with the selected statuses (todo, in progress, done, canceled) |
| Include labels     | Multi-select tag filter — show only tasks that have at least one of the selected tags                  |
| Exclude labels     | Multi-select tag filter — hide tasks that have any of the selected tags                                |
| Files / Folders    | Multi-select dropdown — show only tasks from the selected files or folders                             |

| Hide tags on nodes | Checkbox — hide tag chips on all nodes (only visible when **Show task tags** is enabled in settings)   |

### Reload Tasks

Click **Reload Tasks** to re-read all tasks from the vault. Use this after making changes to notes outside the graph view.

You can also embed a Tasks Map directly in a note — see [Embedding a Tasks Map](embedding.md).
