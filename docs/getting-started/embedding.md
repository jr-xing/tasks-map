# Embedding a Tasks Map

You can embed a fully interactive Tasks Map graph directly inside any note using a fenced code block. The embedded graph supports panning, zooming, and filtering — the same as the main view.

!!! warning
    Tasks Map is pre-v1.0. The embed JSON format — including field names and structure — may change between releases before v1.0 is reached. If you write `tasks-map` code blocks by hand, those blocks may break when you update the plugin. The safest approach is to use the [insert commands](#inserting-an-embed-block) to generate blocks, so that re-inserting them when the format changes is straightforward.

## Inserting an embed block

There are two ways to insert an embed block into a note.

### From the command palette

Run **Tasks Map: Insert current filter as embedded Tasks Map** from the command palette (`Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`). This captures the active filter state from an open Tasks Map view and inserts it as an embed block into the currently active note. If no note is active, you are prompted to pick one.

### From a saved filter preset

In the Tasks Map view, open the **Saved Filters** panel. Select a preset, then click the **Insert into note** button (download icon). You are prompted to pick a note, and the embed block is appended to it using that preset's filter.

!!! tip
    Using one of these two methods is the recommended way to create embed blocks — they produce correctly formatted JSON and avoid manual errors.

## The embed format

An embed block is a fenced code block with the language tag `tasks-map`. The body is a JSON object with two optional top-level keys: `filter` and `config`.

```tasks-map title="Minimal embed"
{}
```

When the body is empty or `{}`, all defaults are used and the full graph is shown.

A more complete example — a compact view showing only starred tasks that are active:

````markdown title="Example embed"
```tasks-map
{
  "filter": {
    "onlyStarred": true,
    "selectedStatuses": ["todo", "in_progress"]
  },
  "config": {
    "height": 300,
    "showMinimap": false,
    "showFilterPanel": false,
    "showPresetsPanel": false,
    "showUnlinkedPanel": false
  }
}
```
````

## Filter options

All fields under `filter` are optional. Omitted fields use their defaults.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `selectedTags` | `string[]` | `[]` | Show only tasks with at least one of these tags |
| `excludedTags` | `string[]` | `[]` | Hide tasks that have any of these tags |
| `selectedStatuses` | `string[]` | all statuses | Show only tasks with these statuses (`"todo"`, `"in_progress"`, `"done"`, `"canceled"`) |
| `selectedFiles` | `string[]` | `[]` | Show only tasks from these files or folders |
| `searchQuery` | `string` | `""` | Pre-filled search query |
| `traversalMode` | `string` | `"match"` | Dependency traversal for search results: `"match"`, `"upstream"`, `"downstream"`, or `"both"` |
| `onlyStarred` | `boolean` | `false` | Show only starred tasks |

## Config options

All fields under `config` are optional. Omitted fields use their defaults.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `height` | `number` | `400` | Height of the embed in pixels |
| `showMinimap` | `boolean` | `true` | Show the minimap |
| `showFilterPanel` | `boolean` | `true` | Show the filter panel |
| `showPresetsPanel` | `boolean` | `true` | Show the saved filters panel |
| `showUnlinkedPanel` | `boolean` | `true` | Show the unlinked tasks panel |
| `showStatusCounts` | `boolean` | `true` | Show the status counts overlay |

## Error states

If something prevents the embed from rendering, a message is shown in place of the graph:

- **Invalid JSON** — the code block body could not be parsed. Re-insert the embed using the command palette or the saved filters panel to generate a valid block.
- **Outdated format** — the block uses a legacy flat format from an earlier version. Re-insert the embed to migrate it to the current format.
